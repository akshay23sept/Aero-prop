### Aerodynamic Efforts of Propellers at High Incidence Angle Using 3D High Fidelity Simulations (Aero-Prop)
This work has been carried out as a part of master's thesis for a period of six months from March 2019 to September 2019 in the Department of Aerodynamics and Propulsion at [ISAE-SUPAERO Toulouse, France](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/recherche/departements/aerodynamique-propulsion/daep/).

## Introduction
<p><code>Aero-Prop</code> repository contains a group of pythonic subroutines (codes) which are developed to foresact the demand for UAM during 2035 to 2050 timeframe for a set of 542 global cities. Each subroutine performs a special task to execute the scenario outsome. The picture shown below shows the working of each subroutines.</p>










############## Brief Intro #################

High incidence angle influences the aerodynamic efforts of rotors which are very important to precisely estimate the performance of vertical take off and landing aircraft. This research work presents the use of Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) to analyze the aerodynamic efforts of rotors at high incidence angles. The simulations were performed in commercial CFD software STAR-CCM+. In the simulation incidence angle were varied from 0° to 90° and the results were compared with the experimental data to validate the computation.
