### Aerodynamic Efforts of Propellers at High Incidence Angle Using 3D High Fidelity Simulations (Aero-Prop)
This work has been carried out as a part of master's thesis for a period of six months from March 2019 to September 2019 in the Department of Aerodynamics and Propulsion at [ISAE-SUPAERO Toulouse, France](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/recherche/departements/aerodynamique-propulsion/daep/).

## Introduction
High incidence angle influences the aerodynamic efforts of rotors which are very important to precisely estimate the performance of vertical take-off and landing aircraft. This research work presents the use of Unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) to analyze the rotors at high incidence angles. <code>Spalart-Allmaras><code> turbulence model was used after comparison with other commonly used RANS models for instance K-$\omega$ SST and K-$\epsilon$ realizable models. 
<p><code>Aero-Prop</code> repository contains a group of pythonic subroutines (codes) </p>










############## Brief Intro #################

High incidence angle influences the aerodynamic efforts of rotors which are very important to precisely estimate the performance of vertical take off and landing aircraft. This research work presents the use of Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) to analyze the aerodynamic efforts of rotors at high incidence angles. The simulations were performed in commercial CFD software STAR-CCM+. In the simulation incidence angle were varied from 0° to 90° and the results were compared with the experimental data to validate the computation.
