############## Brief Intro #################

High incidence angle influences the aerodynamic efforts of rotors which are very important to precisely estimate the performance of vertical take off and landing aircraft. This research work presents the use of Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) to analyze the aerodynamic efforts of rotors at high incidence angles. The simulations were performed in commercial CFD software STAR-CCM+. In the simulation incidence angle were varied from 0° to 90° and the results were compared with the experimental data to validate the computation.
